# CSCI 5030-02 TEAM #1  Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction


# Goal
* You will be implementing advanced tools for spelling correction 
 
* At its most basic, a traditional spell checker   
     * Reports any unrecognized words to the user, along with suggested corrections  
     * For some languages, a simple word list suffices   
     * For other languages, need a dictionary and rules for word formation  
     * e.g. jump/V => jump, jumps, jumped, jumping  

# Basic requirements
* Primary application should be a simple web-based plain text editor  
* Portable across browsers, mobile and desktop  
* Must report all spelling errors, including “real word” errors  
* Must provide a ranked list of suggestions for replacement   
* Must support multiple languages (more on this later)  
* Design should allow your advanced spelling correction to also be easily incorporated into the customer’s existing applications and devices
